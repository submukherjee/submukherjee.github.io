I am currently a fifth year Graduate student in the department of [Electrical and Computer Enginerring](https://ece.msu.edu/) at [**Michigan State University**](https://msu.edu/). I am advised by Professor [Yiming Deng](https://www.egr.msu.edu/deng/) & Professor [Lalita Udpa](https://www.egr.msu.edu/people/profile/udpal) at Non Destructive Evaluation Laboratory, [NDEL](https://www.egr.msu.edu/ndel/). My dissertation is on developing _improved automated NDE methods using Machine Learning perspectives_. On the algorithmic side, I develop novel statistical leaerning based signal and image processing algorithms, ML algorithms and AI enabled NDE algorithms  for better defect detection and identification. I am also interested in data fusion and in developing different sub sampling and sparsifying algorithms for fast scanning systems. On the hardware side I focus on design and development of different physics based sensors and systems for monitoring and evaluating structural integrity of parts and components. The links to published papers and preprints can be accessed from my <a href='https://submukherjee.github.io/Research/'><font face="verdana" color="teal">Research</font></a> page.    currently working as a _Solution Integrator_ in the multinational networking and telecommunications company [**Ericsson**](https://www.ericsson.com/en). I am a part of the **_Work Force Management (WFM)_** team, which advices large service organizations with the optimal ways of scheduling and managing their field service work force. For general operations, we usually use the Click Service Optimization Suite. We are also involved in the development of novel routines for mobile customization using HTML5, C# and JQuery that enable dispatchers and technicians to communicate feedbacks in real time. My roles include developing and executing optimal algorithms and policies in order to assist clients in efficiently handling scheduling and communication assignments to their field force.
