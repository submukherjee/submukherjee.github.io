I am currently a Postdoctoral fellow in the [Division of Imaging, Diagnostics, and Software Reliability](https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/cdrh-offices/division-imaging-diagnostics-and-software-reliability) at US Food and Drug Administration. Before joining FDA, I graduated from Michigan State University with a PhD. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I was advised by Professor Yiming Deng & Professor Lalita Udpa at Non Destructive Evaluation Laboratory, [NDEL](https://www.egr.msu.edu/ndel/). On the algorithmic side, I develop novel statistical learning based signal and image processing algorithms, Artificial Intelligence (AI)- Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for medical and NDE imaging. I am also interested in data fusion, volumetric registration, survival analysis, joint modelling and in developing different sub sampling and sparsifying algorithms. On the hardware side, I focus on design and development of different physics based sensors and systems for monitoring and evaluating structural integrity of parts and components. The indexing of all my published paperscan be accessed from my <a href='https://submukherjee.github.io/Research/'><font face="verdana" color="teal">Research</font></a> page. You can find my [Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m8ziY8zjwzffIgmvwjeNoa7SHM95LKVH/view?usp=sharing) here.
