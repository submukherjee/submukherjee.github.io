During my summer internship at Analog Garage, Boston I worked on the Advanced Battery Monitoring (ABM) project. I was responsible for developing novel transfer learning based statistical algorithms for EV battery state of health (SOH) and State of Power (SOP) estimation. I also developed synthetic battery aging models in Ansys following protocols like that of real experiments to produce simulation data which can serve as digital twinning with experimental data.

During my PhD, I am working as Research Associate on several projects being funded by [EPRI](https://www.epri.com/), [GTI](https://www.gti.energy/), various **CAAP* programs

I was a part of the **_Work Force Management (WFM)_** team, which advices large service organizations with the optimal ways of scheduling and managing their field service work force. For general operations, we usually used the Click Service Optimization Suite. We were also involved in the development of novel routines for mobile customization using HTML5, C# and JQuery that enable dispatchers and technicians to communicate feedbacks in real time. My roles included developing and executing optimal algorithms and policies in order to assist clients in efficiently handling scheduling and communication assignments to their field force.
